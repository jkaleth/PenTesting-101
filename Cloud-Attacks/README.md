# Cloud Attacks
- Cloud Attack Vectors
    - **Malware Injection Attack** -  attempt to add  infected service implementation module to a cloud service. Using SQL or Command injection
    - **Side Channel Attack**- exploti indirect effects of system instead of the code
    - **Direct-To-Origin Attacj (D2O)** - attempts to bypass reverse proxoies to directly attack the IP address of the cloud based server
    - **Denial of Service Attack** - (DOS) Used to attack any protocol, device, OS, or service to try and disrupt services to users. 
    
**How to preven this?**
- Data encryption
- MFA
- Routine monitoring and aufditing

## Credential Harvesting
Exploits use to gain credentials and escalate privileges:
- SAM File- Security Account Management
Contains hashed passwords of every user on a Windows system. This is not exclusive to cloud
- Bypass local windows user account control (UAC) - using process injection
- Hijack DLL files (dynamic link library)- code used by more than on program
- Writeable Services - and unquotes service paths can be used to inject malicous application that will be launched at startup
- 
## Misconfigured Assets
Account, storage, container, or other cloud based resource vulnerable to attack because of it's configuration. 

- Misconfiguration of Identity and access permission
- Object storage
- Containerization tech

Object = file
Container = folder

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** - allow objects to read from multiple domainsand displayed properyly in the browser. 

Container Vulnerabilties:
- Embedded malware
- Missing security updates
- Outdated software
- Config defects
- Hard coded clear text passwords

## Metadata Service Attacks- 
- Data which provides information about other data
- Used in AWS as a service to provide data about instances
- It's a type of SSRF that focuses on taking metadata

**Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)-** an attack that takes advantage of the trust relationship between the server and other resources it can access
- This attack exploits 
    - Vulnerable apps
    - Communicate withmetadata service
    - Extract creds
    - Pivot into cloud account

## Software Development Kits
- SDK package of tools dedicated to a specific programming language. Vulnerabiltiies do exist though. 

## Cloud Auditing
- **ScoutSuite-** open source python tool used to audit instances and policies via API calls. 

- **Prowler** - tool used for best practice assessments, audits, incident response, monitoring, hardening, and forensics for AWS cloud services. It can create reports in HTML, CSV, and JSON.

- **PACU** - explotation framwework used to access security configs of an AWS account. 

- **Cloudbrute** - Used to find a targets infrastructure, files and apps across the cloud service. 

- **Cloudcustodian** - open source cloud security , governance, and management tools to help admins create polcies.
