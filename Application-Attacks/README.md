# Application Attacks

## Directory Traversals
Accessing directories outside the web document root

- ../ on exam - directory traversal
- ../ on exam - local file inclusion

## Dirbuster
Find every single file and folder on the web server. 
You can find hidden files too
Better than a web crawl

```
$dirbuster -h
```
Dirbuster pops up grapical interface

## Cross-Site Scripting
XSS- Malicious script injected into a trusted site 
Requires input validationto prevent an XSS attack
- Identify input validation vunerability
- Attacker crafts a URL to perform codeinjection
- Trusted site will return a page containing the malicious code
- The malicious code is run in the clients browser. 

**What it can do?**
- Defacing website
- Stealing users data
- Intercetpr data
- Install malware 

It breaks the browsers security trust model

Exam Tips- 
- If you see a log snipet with java it most likely is an xss attack
- If you document.cookie or document.something it shoud tell you it's a DOM based attack. 

## Cross-Site Forgery Attacks
Session management- enables web apps to uniquely identify a user by keeping the data assigned to that user. 

Coookie- a text file that stores info about a user when they visit a website

Non-Persisitent Cookie- Short time and reside in memory

Persistent Cookie- Stored in browser cache

Session hijacking- spoofing attack where an attacker disconnects the host and replaces it with their own maching. This is done by cookie theft. 

Non random tokens. 

Session predcition- predicts a session token to hijack the session

Crosss site firgery attack is a malicious script hosted on an attackers site to exploits a sesion that was started on another site and within the same web browser

It can be hidden with html image tags. Vicitm may not even have to click ona link. 

A forgot my paw reset would be good for this type of attack. 

To avoid:
- ensure user specific tokens are used in all form submission
- add 2fa and randomnesss info for password resets. 
- Require user to enter current password before changing it
- 

Exam- getting victim to do an update or change an email address or pw. 

## SQL Injections
- Select > Read the DB
- Insert > Write to the DB
- Delete- > Remove from DB
- Update > Overwrite DB

**Code Injection** - Insert additional code through a data input form from a client to an application. 

**SQL Injection Attack** - Injects a SQL query throught the input form a client uses to send data to a web app. 

How an attacker injects input:

- Through a URL parameter
- Form fields
- Modifying cookies
- POST data
- HTTP headers

How to prevent an SQL injection? - 

- Use input validation and sanatize any data receive from users. 
- Use a Web App firewall

Exam Tips
- If you see **'OR 1=1;** or something=something on the exam think that this has to do with an SQL injection.
