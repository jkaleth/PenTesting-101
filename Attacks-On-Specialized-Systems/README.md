# Attacks on Specialized Systems
 
## IOT (Internet of Things)
If it can connect to the internet it can be considered IOT

    - Wireless refrigerator
    - Snart TV's
    - Lights
    - Security Cameras
    - Cars

## Types of connections

    - Wifi - 802.11
    - Bluetooth - short range wireless
    - RFID - badges and card keys to network
    - Nearfield Communications - 4cm of each other communication- card payments
    - Infrared - light beams. tv remotes
    - ZWave - short range,low latency data transfer
    - ANT + -   moisture sensor, lights on or off, 
    - M2M - Machine t0 machine communication

## Vulnerabilities

        - Insecure hardware components
        - Linux OS and Android OS vulnerabilities. 
        - Insecure defaults
        - Hard-coded configs
        - Cleartext Communication - no encryption
        - Data Leakage- monitor Bluetooth frequency
        

## Embedded Systems
    - Microcontroller- IV drop monitoring
    - Water treatment control system
    - Smart meter for electricity
    - PLC - programmable logic board- Manufacturing to open valves etc...
    - System on Chip (SoC)- multiple logical controllers on one chip
    - Real Time Operatin System - (RTOS)
    - FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) programmable by customer to perform specific function. 

## ICS and Scada Devices

### Operation Technology
Designed to implement an industrial Control system rather than business and network systems.

Its technology that interacts with the real world. 

**Two Types of Systems**
- **Industrial Control System (ICS)** workflow and process automation using embedded devices
    - multiple IC devices to created Distributed Control System (DCS)
    - Fieldbus - links programmablelogic controllers together. 
    - Human Machine Interface - input and output controls on a PLC
    - Ladder Logic - Graphical diagram
    - 
- **SCADA**
Manages large scale multi-site devices spread over a geographical region

- **ICC Protocols and Vulnerabilities** 
    - **CAN (Controller Area Network)** network bus used in vehicles and airplanes. Used like ethernet
        -** ODB-II port** exploit (check enginer light tester)
        - **Cellular Modem** used on vehicle for video and audio stearing ona Tesla
        - **Second system** to control driving system
    - **MOdBus**- allow controls servers ability to query and change configs of each PLC
    - **DDS (Data Distrubiton Service)**- 
    - **SIS (Safety Instrumented System)**- Returns industrial process to a safe state after condition

## Data Storage System Vulnerabilities
- Direct Attached
- SAN
- NAS

## Virtualization
**Type I hypervisor** is a bare-metal virtual platform installed directly onto the hardware and manages access to the host hardware without going through a host operating system.

A **Type II hypervisor** is software installed onto a host operating system and any virtual machines installed on it are a guest and ride on top of the native operating system.

A **type II hypervisor** is a host-based model in which virtual machines installed on it are a guest and ride on top of the native operating system.

A **Hypervisor/Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)** manages the virtual machine environment and is one of at least three components required by a virtual platform.


### Types of Attacks
- **VM Escapes** - When a threat actor attempts to get out of an isolated VM and directly sends commands to the hypervisor. It's easier to perform on a type II hypervisor than a type I. 
- **Vm Hopping** - Moving from one VM to another
- **Vm Sprawl** - Refers to creating Virutal Machine without proper change control.
