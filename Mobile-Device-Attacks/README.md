# Mobile Device Attacks

## Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)
MDM- Mobile Device Management- Airwatch

**EMM -** Policies and Tools

**MDM** - Technical Controls
- Application Controls
- Passwords
- MFA
- Token based access
- Patch Management
- Remote Wipe
- Trust Certificate
- Firmware Update

## Deployment Options

- COBO - corp owned business only
- COPE - corp owned business and personal 
- CYOD- Allows employees to choose own device
- BYOD- Bring your own device
- VMI - Virtual Mobile Infrastructure

## Mobile Recon Concerns
- Digital Forensics
    - Stored in the cloud
    - Stored on an insternal card
- Wearable Technology
- Wireless Eavesdroppping

## Mobile Device Insecurity
- Jailbreaking- give use root privilege to IOS device. Removes all protections and restrictions. Largest attack vector
- Rooting - Android jailbreak for root access. Load custome firmware. Custom ROM
- Sideloading- loading app not from official store
-
**Security Best Practice**

- Device config protocols
- IOS - 256bit  unique ID
- Android - 128bit AES
- HSM Micro Hardware Security Module- stores cryptogrpahic keys securelt inside mobile device. 
- VPN CLient
- Location services
- Geofencing- Creating cirtual boundaries. 

## MFA
- Knowledge - Something you know
- Ownership- Something you have (KFOB, Dongle, etc)
- Characteristic- Something you are. Fingerprint readers, 
- Location- Somewhere you are
- Action- Something you do. 

## Mobile Device Attacks
### IOS 
is like a walled garden and a lot more restrictive
### Android
Was built to be open so it's easier to load malware

- Vishing
- Smishing
- Spamming
- Bluejacking- sending information
- Bluesnarfing- grab info off device

## Malware Analysis
- Sandboxing
    - FlareVM by Fireeye- for Windows 10 and Anroid
    - Cuckoo Sandbox- inside linux, windows, mac. Lots of automation tools. 
    - Honeypot lab for complex analysis

## Mobile Device Tools
- **Drozer** - Security audit and attack framework which provides tools for Anroid 
- **AndroidAPK Decomplier (APXX)** - 
- **APK Studio-** used for Android devlopment
- **Android SDK** 
- **Frida**- open source tool for penetration testers on mobile apps. Best choice for IOS explotation. 
- **Objection** - a runtime mobil exploration toolkit to help assess security posture of mobile apps without requireing a jailbreak. 
- **Needle** - open source framwework used to streamline the security assessment process on IOS apps. 
-**Ettercap**- sniff live conenctions. Toolkit for on-path attacks. 
- **Mobile Security Framwework M(MobSF)** - all in one mobile application testing, malware analysis, and security assessment framwework for static and dynamic analysis
-**Burp Suite**- interception, inspection, and modification of raw traffic passing through. 
Burp Suite has a special odule for assessing IOS devices. 
-**Postman** API platform for building ad using API's
