# Application Vulnerabilities

## Race Condition
In the context of application security, a race condition is a flaw that occurs in a system when the behavior and outcome of an application or system are dependent on the sequence or timing of events. It happens when multiple processes or threads access and manipulate shared resources concurrently.

Here's an analogy to explain race conditions:

Imagine a scenario where two or more runners are competing in a race, and they all try to reach the finish line simultaneously. The winner is determined by who crosses the finish line first. If the outcome depends on the precise timing of each runner's actions, then any alteration in the timing (like one runner moving faster than expected) might change the result.

Similarly, in software, a race condition occurs when the behavior of an application is influenced by the timing of how different threads or processes access shared resources (like memory, files, or data). If the sequence of execution is critical and not properly controlled, it can lead to unexpected or erroneous behavior.

In the context of security, race conditions can be exploited by attackers to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to data or resources. For instance, an attacker might try to interfere with the timing of processes to gain access to restricted information or perform unauthorized actions due to a vulnerability arising from this concurrency issue.

Developers usually mitigate race conditions by implementing proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, semaphores, or other concurrency control techniques, to ensure that shared resources are accessed in a controlled and predictable manner. Moreover, thorough testing and code reviews are crucial to identify and address potential race condition vulnerabilities in software applications.  

## Buffer Overflow
Store data outside data range. 

A buffer overflow is a type of software vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer, or a storage space in memory, than it can actually hold. This overflow can cause the extra data to overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to erratic behavior, crashes, or even exploitation by attackers.

Here's how it typically happens:

    Limited buffer size: Many programs allocate a specific amount of memory (a buffer) to hold data. If a program tries to write more data than the allocated space, it can overflow.

    Overwriting adjacent memory: When the data exceeds the buffer's capacity, it spills over into adjacent memory locations. This can corrupt other data or overwrite critical program structures, like return addresses, function pointers, or control data.

    Exploitation: Attackers can take advantage of buffer overflows to inject malicious code into the program's memory. By carefully crafting the excess data, they can overwrite important data or inject code that the program unintentionally executes. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, enabling the attacker to gain control of the application or the system.

Buffer overflows can have severe security implications, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, crash systems, or gain unauthorized access. Developers typically use various techniques like input validation, proper bounds checking, and secure coding practices to mitigate the risk of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in their software. Security updates and patches are regularly released to fix these vulnerabilities once identified.

## Authentication and References

- Broken Authentication- insecure authentication mechanisms. Easy passwords or coding flaws. 

**OWASP Recommendations:**
- Use mult factor auth
- Never use default creds
- Verify passewords are strong and not on any exploitation lists. 
- Use delays to slow failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks. 
- User server side session management
- Never pass a session id as a url paramter
- Implement session timeouts. 

Insecure Direct Object Reference- used to manipulate URLS to gain access to a resource without requringproper auth

## Improper Error Handling

Default error codes canleak sensitive information
Use custom error handlers

## Improper Headers
OWASP secure headers project
Default headers can leak sensitive information:

- HSTS- protect against protocal downgrade attacks and cooke hijacking. Only use https connections
- HPKP- Http public key pinning allows https websites to resist impersonation by attackers using fraudulent certs. 
- X-Fram Options header- prevent clikjacking. 
- X-XSS-Protection- enables cross site scripting filter in browser
- X-Content-Type-Options- Prevents browser from interpreting files as something other than what they are. 
- Content-Security_policy (CSP) - Impacts how browsers render pages. 
- X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Polocies- Sends a corss-domain policy file to web client to specify if the browser has permission to handle data across domains. 
- Referrer Policy- which referrer info should be included with requets made. 
- Expect-CT- Cert Transparency Compliance
- Feature-Policy- allows developers to selectively enable and disable  use of various browser features and API's  

## Code Signing
Digitally signs executabls and scripts to confirm the software author and guranteee code has notbeen altered. 

Uses cryptographic hashes 

Code signing validates the code is ready for distribution. 

## Vulnerable Components

- **Client Dide/Server Side Processing** - 
    - Client side puts load on users machine. But not always secure. Much quiker to execute code. Web based game example
    - Server side processing is known to bemore secure. 

- **JSON Rest** - 
A client/server model for interacting with content on remote systems over http. Support XML, Javascript, and JSON. Subject to injection attacks. Good for mobile devices

- **SOAP** - Simple Object Access Protocol - Security/Transactional services. Used for exchanging structural information for web services. 

- **Browser Extensions** - 
Provides extended functionality to browsers. PLugins no longer used. Moved to extension from 3rd party vendors
- **HTML 5** - 
Latest version of html. negates need for flash or acive x. 
- **AJAX**- 
Asyncronous Javascript and XML- used to create asyncronous web apps on the client side. 
- **Machine Code** - 
Basic instruction written in machine language to be Able to be executed by the CPU. 
- **Bytecode** - 
Code produced by a compiler that can be translated into machine code.
