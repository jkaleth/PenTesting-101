# Wireless Attacks

## Wireless Security
  - WEB (802.11) original standard - Wired equivalent privacy
  - WPA (Wi-fi protected Access) uses TKIP
  - WPA2- uses ccmp, (802.11i) AES 128 bit encryption
  - WPA3 - Personal - 128bit- AES  CCMP
  - WPA3 - Enterprise - 256bit - AES with SHA -384 
    - SAE Simultaneous Authentication of Equals - password based authentication
    - Forward Secrecy 
      - Step 1- pair of long term keys is created
      - Step 2- one-time use session key is exchanged
      - Step 3- AP send client messages and encrypts them  using the created session key
      - Step 4- Client decrypts messgae using the same one-time use session key
      - Step 5- Process repeats for each message sent starting at step 2
  - WPS Wi-Fi protected setup- 8 digit pin code. it breaks it up into 4 digits chunks which are very easy to crack. So it should ALWAYS be disabled
  
**Exam Quick tips**
- Open  - No security or encryption used
- WEP - Identify weakness as an initialization vector (IV)
- WPA- RC4 and TKIP are exploitable
- WPA2- AES and CCMP are exploitable
- WPA3- Dragonfly 

** MAC Filtering
Change mac adress with macchanger -a

## Bypassing MAC Filtering
know devices kwown so you can connect. 
Change MAC address to their MAC address using macchanger to get assinged new random mac address- this masks who you are. 

to spoof- change one to mimic user

## Signal Exploitation

- Eavesdropping
  - Promiscuous Mode- put adapter into this mode- all network packets can be viewed by all network adapters. Allows sfiffing to happen
- Deauthentication- boot a wireless client off an access point to it's forced to reauthenticate. - typically used with other attacks. 
- Jamming- disrupts a wi-fi signal by broadcasting on the same frequency as the target access point to block signals that a wireless transciever attempts to send or receive. 


## WEP Hacking - very insecure
- 24bit IV only 
- Airomon-NG - used to monitor wirless frequencies to identify access points and clients. 
- Airodump-NG - capture network traffic and send to PCAP
- Airocrack- brute force password cracking 

## WPA/WPA2 Hacking
- Put wireless adapter in promiscuous mode with Airomon-NG
- Discover WPA networks using Airodump-NG
- Capture the network traffic and write to PCAP file
- Conduct a deauthentication attack to generate handshakes to capture 
- Conduct a dictionary attack to identify the plain text version of the preshared key

## WPS PIN Attacks
Use wash
Use reaver

## Evil Twins
A fake wifi access point that appears to be legit but is setup to eavesdrop. 

## On-Path and Relay Attacks

## Bluetooh Artifacts

## RFIS and NFC Attacks
